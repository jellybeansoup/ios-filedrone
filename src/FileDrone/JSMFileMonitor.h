/**
 * An `JSMFileMonitor` object allows you to watch for changes in a directory. When a change is detected, it can
 * notify a given target by calling a selector.
 *
 * Instances of `JSMFileMonitor` do not list changes made, but simply note that a change has occurred. From there,
 * you can respond to the change as you need to. It should also be noted that a `JSMFileMonitor` object will only
 * monitor the direct children of the given URL; the contents of subfolders are not monitored.
 *
 * If you require a list of changes made to the filesystem, or if you need to monitor an entire directory tree, then you
 * should use an instance of `JSMFileDrone` instead.
